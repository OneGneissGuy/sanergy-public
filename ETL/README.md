Some of the data came in SPSS format. We used R to convert it to CSV:

1. We ran an RStudio server on our server.
2. Create an ssh tunnel: ```ssh -i ~/.ssh/[your private key] -fNL [your port number]:localhost:8787 [your username]@[server name]```
3. Open your web browser and go to ```localhost:[your port number]```

Replace the information in the brackets with your info.
